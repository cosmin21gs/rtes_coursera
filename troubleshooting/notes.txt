* Inability to connect vscode to target via remote-ssh
Problem is described in
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/issues/3210
Solution:
(m+)e(f+)'s reply:
In short, the linux target doesn't interpret paths with \ right, so you need to
make a config file in a windows path but with / as a separator (AOTR:
C:/Users/cosmin_ns/.ssh/config ) containing something like:
Host rpi.local
  HostName rpi.local
  User pi

and aditionally:
  IdentityFile C:/Users/johndoe/.ssh/id_rsa

just in case you configured public-private key authentication via ssh with the
target as explained in:

AOTR connection is via password (including in vscode)
